In this exercise Japanese credit screening dataset is used to predict whether people were granted credit or not. 
The dataset is taken from UCI machine learning repository

I used Random Forest algorithm on a dataset with 15 features (continuous and cathegoric) to predict the credit approval outcome.
The feature names in the original dataset were changed to meaningless symbols to prodect data confidentiality. 
Therefore, all feature names are ignored.
