In this exercise readings of 10 different censors are used to predict the nitrogen oxide (Nox) emissions of a gas turbine located in Turkey.
The data is taken from UCI machine learning repository 

The dataset contains the following features:

Ambient temperature (AT): C <br>
Ambient pressure (AP): mbar <br>
Ambient humidity (AH): (%) <br>
Air filter difference pressure (AFDP): mbar <br>
Gas turbine exhaust pressure (GTEP): mbar <br>
Turbine inlet temperature (TIT): C <br>
Turbine after temperature (TAT): C <br>
Compressor discharge pressure (CDP): mbar <br>
Turbine energy yield (TEY): MWH <br>
Carbon monoxide (CO): mg/m3 <br>
Nitrogen oxides (NOx): mg/m3 - target variable
